This has memozation removed and the Racket specific boiler plate, square brackets, etc.

Notes:

    From the Racket Style Guide : https://docs.racket-lang.org/style

    6.1 Where to Put Parentheses
        Racket isnâ€™t C. Put all closing parentheses on one line, the last line of your code.

Stuff that nonsense. I need to pull those brackets appart to have any chance to see what is going on.
