This has memozation removed and the Racket specific boiler plate, square brackets, etc.  

    $ time scheme --script fibo.chez.scm | head -c 32

Origin: Derived from fibo.racket.scm by Heater.

This has Racket specific boiler plate, square brackets, etc removed  
Added import statements.
Changed memoization to use SRFI 69 hast tables.

This is slow. The memoization shaves nearly a whole minute of it's run time!

    $ time chibi-scheme fibo.chibi.scm | head -c 32
    10727395641800477229364813596225

Notes:

    From the Racket Style Guide : https://docs.racket-lang.org/style

    6.1 Where to Put Parentheses
        Racket isnâ€™t C. Put all closing parentheses on one line, the last line of your code.

Stuff that nonsense. I need to pull those brackets appart to have any chance to see what is going on.
