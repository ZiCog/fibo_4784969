1) There is a bug in the FIBO.A60 as presented.

See this forum post: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=62&t=227343&start=150#p1395962

2) There exists a modified version of this code that compiles with the algol 60 compiler here:
https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/algol-60-compiler.git

Sadly the executable segfaults! Needs investigation.
