Sadly we have no instructions for building or running this. We don't have an Elliott 803 anyway! So no actual fibo(4784969$) but it's here because it's beautiful.

You may be able to get an Elliot 803 emulator from here: http://peteronion.org.uk/Elliott/

You may remember way back on page 5 I posted some Algol-60 for computing (relatively) large Fibonacci numbers on the Elliott 803.

Well last weekend that code was actually useful ! It showed up a memory fault on the real Elliott 803 that the store test programmes failed to detect !

So as far as I'm concerned computing large Fibonacci numbers IS useful :-)
